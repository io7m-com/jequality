## jequality

The `jequality` package provides functions to compare floating-point numbers,
annotations to mark classes as using specific types of equality, and a validator
for equality methods.

## Status

As the Java platform evolves, libraries that may have been necessary in the
past can become unnecessary due to new platform features. If you were already
using `jequality`, then you know what it does and why you were using it. If
you aren't already using `jequality`, then you should not start.

This package is in maintenance mode and will not see any new functionality.

Use [equalsverifier](https://jqno.nl/equalsverifier/) as a replacement for
the `jequality` validator.

Use JDK 17 record types to eliminate a lot of the issues with `equals()` and
`hashCode()`.

Use JUnit 5 assertions to perform approximate equality checks of floating-point
values in unit tests. Outside of unit tests, find some other way to compare
numbers.
